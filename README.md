# Milestone Framework Public Repository

The milestone was born with the idea of ​​being a framework to facilitate the process of monitoring, evaluating and aiding adaptation in self-adaptive systems.

Initially, it consisted of a Java library, which had to be imported into the project code.

As the project evolved, the idea of ​​inserting machine learning algorithms was envisioned, making the process more efficient.

With this, the project was changed to Python, and the milestone went from an imported library to code that must be executed on the system server.


//## Installation

//Currently, the installation process consists of adding the project classes to the desired self-adaptive system, paying attention to the hierarchy system presented by the project.
## Improvements

The improvements listed for the framework consist of:

I - Convert each subproject into a library to facilitate import and use
Done

II - Improvement of the planning stage, with the addition of intelligent algorithms native to the framework
Done

III - Transform the framework into a more complete platform, combined with the LoCCAM Middleware platform
 - [LoCCAM Middleware ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2480362.2480465)
